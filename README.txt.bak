Improvements from last assessments comments
-----------------------------------
- Mesh class is now a mesh class that only handles generating a shape and rendering it
- Gameobject class now exists and requires a mesh pointer to render
- Filepaths have been auto added for ease of use (e.g "Rayman.jpg" instead of "Resources/Textures/...")
- PVM calculated on CPU side
- No basicShader, from now on they will be specialised
